Create an app to test students on their ability to subtract,
multiply, divide and add decimal numbers. It will have a simple interface in
form of a terminal and will write the results to a text file in the same folder.
There will be random numbers generated, from 0 to 1000 and decimal points up to 2.
The computer will then check the student's answer and compare it to the correct one.
If correct, it will give one point, if not, no points are awarded. There will
be 20 questions in total.

Extension: send the results to an email? Calculate a percentage and send it in
that form.

Further extension: make a GUI application with the tkinter module
